                <h2>Historiography</h2>
                <p>Early historians had an overwhelmingly negative view of Sambhaji. The first author to write an
                    extensive history of the Marathas was James Grant Duff, whose 1826 work painted Sambhaji as a
                    debauched and unfit ruler.[52][53] Mahadev Govind Ranade, writing around 1900, came to a similar
                    conclusion, writing that "It is useless to enter into a detailed account of Sambhaji's reign, for
                    Sambhaji never can be said to have ruled the country."[52][54]

                    Govind Sakharam Sardesai's 1946 work the New History of Marathas is the first modern treatment of
                    Sambhaji's life. Sardesai's chapter on Sambhaji is entitled "Sambhaji the violent."[5] Sardesai
                    describes Sambhaji both as a heroic leader in the war against the Mughals and "brave as a lion
                    personally," but also as having "vicious and intemperate habits."[5]: 308  Sardesai also assesses
                    that Sambhaji lacked his father's patience or foresight.[5]: 308  Sardesai assesses that Sambhaji's
                    aborted attack against the Portuguese at Goa marked a turning point for Sambhaji's fortunes, after
                    which the Marathas were increasingly on the defensive.[5]: 307  Sardesai concludes that whatever
                    Sambhaji's strategic failings, which saw him abandoned by most of his allies, the nature of his
                    death steeled the Maratha to avenge the death of their sovereign.[5]: 316 </p>

                <h3>Biographies</h3>
                <p>Kavindra Paramanand Govind Newaskar of Poladpur composed Anupurana, a partially-completed Sanskrit
                    biography on the life of Chhatrapati Sambhaji up to the birth of Shahu I, as a sequel to his
                    father's Sanskrit biography Shivabharata. Hari Kavi, also known as Bhanubhatta, composed Haihayendra
                    Charitra as well as its commentary, Shambu Vilasika on the orders of Sambhaji. Hari Kavi also
                    authored Subhashitaharavalli and composed the Sanskrit biography Shambhuraja Charitra on Sambhaji's
                    life and romance in 1684.[55][43]: n15

                <h3>Succession</h3>
                <p>The Maratha Kingdom was put into disarray by Sambhaji's death and his younger half-brother Rajaram I
                    assumed the throne. Rajaram shifted the Maratha capital far south to Jinji, while Maratha guerrilla
                    fighters under Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav continued to harass the Mughal army. A few days
                    after Sambhaji's death, the capital Raigad Fort fell to the Mughals. Sambhaji's widow, Yesubai, son,
                    Shahu and Shivaji's widow, Sakvarbai were captured; Sakvarbai died in Mughal captivity.[11]: 47 
                    Shahu, who was seven years of age when captured, remained prisoner of the Mughals for 18 years from
                    February 1689 until Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's death in 1707. Shahu was then set free by Emperor
                    Muhammad Azam Shah, son of Aurangzeb. After his release, Shahu had to fight a brief succession war
                    with his aunt Tarabai, Rajaram's widow who claimed the throne for her own son, Shivaji
                    II.[38][39][4]: 201–202  The Mughals kept Yesubai captive to ensure that Shahu adhered to the terms
                    of his release. She was released in 1719 when the Marathas became strong under Shahu and Peshwa
                    Balaji Vishwanath.[40]

                <h3>Marriage</h3>
                <p>Sambhaji was married to Jivubai in a marriage of political alliance and as per Maratha custom, she
                    took the name Yesubai. Jivubai was the daughter of Pilaji Shirke, who had entered Shivaji's service
                    following the defeat of Deshmukh Suryaji Surve who was his previous liege. This marriage thus gave
                    Shivaji the access of the region of Konkan coastal belt.[11]: 4, 47 [9]: 96–99  Yesubai had two
                    children, daughter Bhavani Bai and then a son named Shahu I, who later became the Chhatrapati of the
                    Maratha kingdom. According to Maasir-i-Alamgiri, daughters of Sambhaji and his brother Rajaram were
                    married to Mughal noblemen.[12]
